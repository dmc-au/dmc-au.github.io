## Problems and Perspective

I find it easiest to understand a concept when I can see it visually, and from many different angles.
Thankfully, there's plenty of ways to visualise things in the world of mathematics and computer science.

In this post, I'd like to demonstrate the importance of a problem's 'representation'.
While doing so, I'll shed some light on neural networks, which are a fancy form of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in which a computer 'learns' how to solve a problem.

To set up the example, let's consider the following formulae which will generate some numbers for us:

It's quite difficult to visualise what pattern these numbers fall into just by looking at the formulae.
Let's see what these numbers look like if we plot them on a plane.

Armed with the perspective that these numbers represent X and Y co-ordinates, we can clearly see a pattern.
If I asked you to describe what you're seeing, you're likely to suggest that the points form two distinct 'spirals' without having to think too much.

Although it was easy for you, computers generally find this kind of classification task difficult.
Let's label the pairs of points with a 1 if the point belongs to the first spiral, and a 2 if the point belongs to the second spiral.
